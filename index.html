The GRESB API is in the early stages of development.  All documentation below is subject to change.  If you have any feedback regarding our API or the documentation, we would love to hear it! Feel free to submit your comments or questions here

<p><strong>Endpoint:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight plaintext">https://api.gresb.com
</pre>

<p>GRESB will provide an Application Programming Interface (API) web service to facilitate the entry of asset level data into the GRESB survey.  </p>

<p>The API complies with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> protocol.  It uses HTTP response codes to report errors, and responds to the HTTP methods detailed below.  Data is accepted in JSON format and responses are returned in JSON.  The API uses <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</a> for authorization.  It will also provide test-mode access keys to allow users to explore the API without altering data.  </p>

<p>GRESB strives to keep asset level data consistent, whether it is received via the API, the excel upload, or is entered directly.  For this reason, GRESB offers a data dictionary to assist with formatting.  In rare cases, GRESB may restrict access to specific data fields to avoid redundant data.  </p>

<p>The GRESB API uses four basic HTTP verbs; each communicates a unique request</p>

<h1 id='authorization'>Authorization</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The key below can be used to access the API test environment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The GRESB API uses OAuth 2.0 protocol to securely authorize accounts.  More information on authorization will be coming soon.</p>

<p>HTTP Basic Auth is used for our test environment.  You can access the API test environment at any point using the access key provided to the right. </p>
<h1 id='basic-operations'>Basic Operations</h1>
<p><strong>The API gives you the ability to upload all asset level data in bulk, using JSON.  After uploading, every asset will be assigned an unique ID and can be edited individually using this ID.  All commands are based on the HTTP methods outlined by rest protocol.</strong>  </p>

<h3 id='put-amp-post'>PUT &amp; POST</h3>
<p>The PUT method is used to update, or add to a survey responses asset data.  It is important to avoid uploading duplicate assets when using this method.  The best way to avoid this is that, when updating,  ensure that each asset is assigned the correct building id codes.  The POST method will replace all previous data uploaded by your account with the current upload.  This will create new building ids for all assets.  </p>

<p>In order to ensure the accurate upload of asset level data, after a submission, the user will receive an HTTP response code, as well as a JSON file with further information outlining all data related errors.  The response body will clearly indicate which data points are in error, as well providing information as to why the data was not accepted.  For information about specific fields, as well as further assistance with errors, see the data dictionary.  </p>

<p>Data related errors will often result from data that is incomplete or not within the parameters of a data field.  They can also result from attempting to assign multiple assets to the same address, or attempting to edit variable fields that are not assigned to the account.  </p>

<p>HTTP response codes indicate success or failure of an API request. Generally, codes in the 200s indicate success, codes in the 400s indicate a user side error, and codes in the 500s indicate an error with GRESB&rsquo;s servers.
