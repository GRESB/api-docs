# Integrity Rules

The GRESB Portal contains integrity rules to ensure data quality. These integrity rules are displayed as validation warnings and are enforced in the Asset Portal. For best practices GRESB will lists the integrity rules enforced in the Asset Portal, as well as integrity rules applied in the scoring algorithm. 

## Asset Portal

* `partners_id` - must be present
* `property_type` - must be present and one of the list values
* `asset_country` - must be present and one of the list values
* `asset_address` - must be present and contain a location, please be as specific as possible (e.g. Barbara Strozzilaan 101 1083 HN Amsterdam, or Barbara Strozzilaan 101 Amsterdam, or 1083 HN Amsterdam, or Amsterdam)
* `asset_const_year` must be a four digit positive number
* `asset_ind` - must be present 
* `asset_size` - must be present
* `asset_own` - must be present and between 0-12
* `major_renovation` - must be present
* `dc_change` - must be present
* `cov` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_cov`) â‰¤ `tot` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_tot`)
* `man` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_cov`) only valid for managed assets
* `ind` (e.g. `en_ind_wwg_abs`) only valid for indirectly managed assets
* `abs` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_abs`), `cov` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_cov`), and `tot` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_tot`) must always be present as a group

## Scoring Algorithm

* `asset_const_year` may never be larger than the current year - 1
* `asset_gav` is an abnormalty above 5500, likely to be due to non-metric reporting (non USD millions)
* `asset_size` for an asset reporting on whole building must equal `asset_size_whole`
* `asset_size` for an asset reporting on base building + tenant space must be at least the sum of `asset_size_common` and `asset_size_tenant_landlord`, and at max the sum of `asset_size_common`, `asset_size_shared`, `asset_size_tenant_landlord`, and `asset_size_tenant_tenant`.
* `tot` (e.g. `en_man_bcf_tot`) may never be larger than the `area_size` of the reported area (e.g. `area_size_common`)
