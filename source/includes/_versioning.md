# Versioning
Your API version will be set the first time you use the GRESB API.  All updates to our API will be documented in a changelog, and you will have the ability to upgrade your API to the newest version at any point.  If a backwards-incompatible update is released, all API users will be notified in advanced and be given ample time to upgrade.
