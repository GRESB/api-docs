# Introduction

GRESB will provide an Application Programming Interface (API) web service to facilitate the entry of asset level data into the GRESB survey.  

The API complies with REST protocol.  It uses HTTP response codes to report possible errors, and responds to the HTTP commands detailed in this document.  

The API can accept data in JSON, and all responses will be returned in JSON.  

All actions through GRESB's API will be authorized using OAuth 2.0.  Click here for further assistance.

GRESB strives to keep all funds’ asset level data consistent, whether it is received via the API or the asset level excel upload.  For this reason, GRESB offers a data dictionary to assist in the process of formatting data correctly.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
